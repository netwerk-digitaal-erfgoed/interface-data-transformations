Please check the CSV files.

Not all files are gathered by codes. Vanabbemuseum and museum-de-Fundatie have two formats(i.e., jpg and jfif(shown mostly in JPG)) for pictures if you download them manually.
In the dataset, there is a jpg format that is not correct. I collect them also manually and separately process them. That is why you have two report files one in jpg format and another one for jfif.

for all datasets, the filename is the number at the end subject URI, except Vanabbemuseum i.e., collected manually and 
the name of the file is the number of pictures.
