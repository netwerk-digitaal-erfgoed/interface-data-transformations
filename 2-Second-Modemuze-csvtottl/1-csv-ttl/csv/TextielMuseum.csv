Elke vleugel kan opengeklapt worden, waaronder een lichtgeel fluweel buideltje zichtbaar wordt met aan de bovenzijde een rits.Citaat L. op de Hoek(1993): 'Ik maak draagbare objecten en tassen die geïnspireerd zijn op dieren. In mijn werk spelen aanvals- en verdedigingsmechanismen een grote rol. De objecten kunnen zowel een aanvallend agressief als een kwetsbaar of verleidelijk karakter hebben. Ze bestaan afwisselend uit harde en zachte materialen en vormen. Zo ontstond in 1992 een collectie 'Schildtassen'. Deze collectie slaat terug op de insektenwereld.

De tas is van fluweel en wordt als het ware gedragen door venijnige scharen van hout met een messing punt, waarop het object tevens als een soort sculptuur staat. Daarin zit ook het contrast: enerzijds aantrekkelijk en verleidelijk (fluweel) anderzijds venijnig (hout, metaal, kunststof).L op de Hoek (1993):
In 1993 heb ik twee series gemaakt. De eerste serie is geïnspireerd op Afrikaanse diersoorten. Zij bestaat uit kleinere en prak¬tische, draag¬bare tassen. De tassen doen agressief aan. 
De tweede serie is geba¬seerd op zoogdieren en heeft een zacht en koes¬terend karakter. De tassen zijn signalen - voor mij is het menselijk gedrag vaak dierlijker dan we willen erkennen. Belang¬rijk is dan ook de wijze waarop de objecten gehanteerd worden.  

De collectie van 1994 is getiteld 'Zachte wachters'. Van aanvals- en verdedigingsmechanismen is bij deze objecten weinig sprake. Ze hebben juist een open en zacht karakter.
Evenals bij een skelet worden in deze objecten de zachte materialen ondersteund en beschermd door stevige materialen. De objecten kunnen niet gedragen worden. ","BK0327","nl","'Krabtas'","IMAGE","nl","1990","","","","","Overspel?

December 1969'.Het bedrijf Texoprint uit Boekelo nodigt van 1958 tot 1999 jaarlijks kunstenaars uit om relatiegeschenken te ontwerpen voor de reeks ‘With the Season’s Greetings’. Verschillende Cobra-kunstenaars tekenen een kleurrijk ontwerp voor gedrukte sjaals. Voor kunstenaars als Karel Appel, Lucebert en Wolvekamp vormen deze ontwerpen zeldzame uitstapjes in de wereld van het textieldesign.

De onderste staal op blad 08756n is van Anni Albers (toeschrijving  Judith Raum). Deze staal van een zeer fraaie en functionele structuurstof is van de hand van de Duitse Anni Albers. In 1929 ontwikkelt zij een geluidsdichte en reflecterende wandbespanning van cellofaan en chenille voor het auditorium van de vakbondsschool van de Allgemeine Deutsche Gewerkschaftsbund (AGB) in Bernau. De tegenstelling met het traditioneel voor dergelijke doeleinden toegepaste fluweel springt in het oog. De moderne stof toont aan de voorzijde een glanzend en licht reflecterend cellofaan, een opkomend materiaal, en aan de achterzijde chenille, dat geluiddempend is.

Verbindend element is een conceptuele benadering en een onconventionele omgang met materiaal en techniek. Het TextielMuseum benadert haar in het kader van het door museum geïnitieerde ‘Dutch Souvenirs’ project. Van der Lubbe kiest intieme alledaagse voorwerpen als een zakdoek en een kussensloop als dragers voor technologische en socio-economische informatie over Nederland. De informatie over de waterkering en werkeloosheid, die zij aan het cartografisch instituut Wolters- Noordhoff ontleent, verwerkt zij in kleurige borduursels. Op die manier deelt zij kennis over Nederland in plaats van nostalgische plaatjes die traditioneel souvenirs sieren te laten zien.","12555a=f","nl","'Waterkering', zakdoek  (uit serie: 'Facts & Figures')","IMAGE","nl","2003","nl","ontwerper","nl","","SUBJECTS.

(Denk aan de sinnespelen uit de Rederijkerstijd 15e, 16e eeuw). De rokken zijn door de kunstenaar opgebouwd uit traditionele en nieuwe stoffen. Daarop heeft zij een tekst geborduurd ooit uitgesproken of geschreven door iemand. De rok is een lange koker die dubbel gedragen wordt. De geborduurde tekst staat op de ene helft en een compositie van gekleurde vlakken of anders, verfraait de andere helft. Wil je de tekst uitdragen dan kies je voor de geborduurde kant voor, zo niet, dan houd je de tekst voor jezelf aan de binnenkant. De rok heeft de volgende tekst (de woorden hiervan zijn in spiegelbeeld op de rok geborduurd): 'toen - voortdurend - herinnering - aldoor - nabij - ergens - nergens - hoe dan - doorgaan - kwetsbaar - kusje - fragiel - onzeker - stijl - niets - iets - eens -saam - schouderklopje - wegebben - vergaan - aai - nooit voorbij - wil'.
'In de Sinnerok MAMA verbeeld ik het contact dat ik met mijn moeder had, vooral in haar laatste levensjaar. Wekelijks borduurde ik voor haar een woord op een zakdoekje en stuurde het naar haar op of bracht het mee. Kusje, schouderklopje, stijl, aai, voortdurend, toen, nooit voorbij, wil etc. Ze heette Wil en deed haar naam eer aan. Ze hield van zakdoekjes, vooral met bloemmotief. Als kind mochten we soms ook even de eau-de-cologne opsnuiven, als ze haar zakdoekje uit haar tasje haalde.
Na haar dood borduurde ik de woorden in spiegelbeeld, d.w.z. niet te lezen voor het publiek, op een oude theater- rok, en plaatste ook de zakdoekjes erop.
Mijn moeder was gek op textiel. Ik was blij  en aangenaam verrast dat het Audax Textiel Museum juist deze rok voor hun collectie kochten.'( Lam de Wolf) ","BK0858","nl","'Sinnerok MAMA'","IMAGE","nl","2004","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amstelveen","Geborduurd","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_BK0858","localID/europeana-fashion/BK0858","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_BK0858","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/BK0858-01.jpg","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/BK0858-01.jpg"

Naast haar collectie stalen ontwerpt Van Eerdenburg ook haar eigen collectie van driedimensionale machinaal gebreide sjaals, plaids en kussens. De eenvoudigste manier voor het creëren van driedimensionale breisels is het gebruik van elastische garens. De ontwerper kiest er echter voor om driedimensionaliteit door een slim gebruik van de breitechniek te realiseren. De Knit&Wear-breimachine breit letterlijk de ruimte in.

Door plaatselijk toeren te maken, ontstaan verbredingen van het breisel, dat bij de afname van de toeren een reliëf vormt.Van Eerdenburg, die als modeontwerper is afgestudeerd, stortte zich een aantal jaren geleden geheel op het ontwikkelen van machinale breisels, waarvan zij stalen verkocht aan modeontwerpers als Donna Karan en Calvin Klein. Naast haar collectie stalen ontwerpt Van Eerdenburg ook haar eigen collectie van driedimensionale machinaal gebreide sjaals, plaids en kussens. De eenvoudigste manier voor het creëren van driedimensionale breisels is het gebruik van elastische garens. De ontwerper kiest er echter voor om driedimensionaliteit door een slim gebruik van de breitechniek te realiseren. De Knit&Wear-breimachine breit letterlijk de ruimte in. Door plaatselijk te vermeerderen ontstaat een verbreding van het breisel, die bij vermindering van toeren een reliëf vormen. ","14365","nl","'Little clouds'","IMAGE","nl","2006","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","High Tech Low Tech - design tussen traditie en innovatie","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_14365","localID/europeana-fashion/14365","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_14365","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/14365-01.JPG","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/14365-01.JPG"

Aan de uiteinden zijn de bolvormen onbedekt gebleven. De sluiting voor wordt gevormd door een bol door een lus te trekken. 'Het oppervlak van alles wat Braga maakt vormt een strijdperk: intensief bewerkt en mede daardoor geladen met betekenissen. Groei, overdaad, verval, vervreemding, beschadiging: kernbegrippen rond de 'condition humaine'. Bij de nieuwste objecten lijkt een  fluwelen nacht ingetreden, suggestief als een peilloze sterrenhemel. Het zwarte mysterie betekent geen statisch universum: beschadigingen en vervormingen lijken te genezen, overal is groei te bespeuren en het leven dringt door alle poriën.' Citaat Ward Schrijver (bij expositie in Galerie Rob Koudijs, Amsterdam).Deze 'choker' maakt deel uit van de collectie 'Negros' die bestaat uit 14 objecten, die aan het lichaam zijn gerelateerd.
'Negros' is het derde en laatste deel van een serie werken. Alle series gaan over beschermingsrituelen gerelateerd aan organen van het lichaam. Negros (Zwart, gaat over dood, rouw en transformatieprocessen. (zie ook opm.)
Célio Braga maakt geen sieraden. Hij kijkt naar mensen en naar hun interactie en reageert met het maken van objecten. Soms is het resultaat te dragen als broche of collier. Waarachtig toegepaste kunst: het voorwerp dat vragen stelt en suggesties aanreikt kan je de hele dag bij je houden. Als herinnering, als confrontatie, als geuzenteken. De thematiek van het werk van de deels in Brazilië, deels in Nederland wonende kunstenaar Célio Braga (*1963) is de mens, en in het bijzonder de fragiliteit van het menselijk lichaam. Liefde, verlangens, vriendschap gaan gepaard met ziekte, verdriet, verlies en dood. Choker (een korte, brede stropdas of halsdoek), veelal door mannen gedragen, maakt deel uit van de serie Negros. Negros (zwart) verwijst naar processen van dood, rouw en transformatie. De oppervlakte van Choker is intensief bewerkt als een vorm van liefdevolle bezwering van de verloren persoon.","BK0878","nl","Choker, uit de serie 'Negros'","IMAGE","nl","2007","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","Possible jewellery and related objects","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_BK0878","localID/europeana-fashion/BK0878","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_BK0878","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/BK0878-01.jpg","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/BK0878-01.jpg"

Met deze zes basisvormen is een totaal nieuw en zeer draagbaar kledingconcept ontstaan. Inclusief film (DVD kopie van de in 2000 digitaal opgenomen videofilm, getiteld 'Ruimvel' en behorende bij totale concept 'Ruimvel'). De vormen op zich kunnen van vorm veranderen. Op het lichaam zetten de vormen je aan tot bewegen. De gesloten en open spiraalvormige tubes kunnen op allerlei verschillende manieren worden gedragen en gecombineerd worden. Er is geen verschil tussen binnen en buiten. De vorm op zich is autonoom en veroorzaakt een natuurlijke relatie tot het lichaam en beweging. Vanuit de bolling gaat het om drie vormen: (a-b) de arm-/ beentube; (c) de hoofdtube (d) de lichaamstube. Vanuit de holling gaat het ook om drie vormen: (e) de zeewiershawl; (f ) de zeewiershawl groot; (g) de zeewierdeken. De 7e vorm is de zeewiertube shawl, een combinatie van convexe en concave potentie van de gebreide spiraalvormige tube (h-i).

Sindsdien werkt ze als ontwerper in Nederland en Japan. Boon is vaker te gast in het TextielLab. Haar specialiteiten zijn driedimensionale weefsels en stoffen die zodanig zijn geconstrueerd, dat er een bijna kant-en-klaarproduct op de weefmachine ontstaat. Op uitnodiging van het Textielmuseum ontwierp Samira Boon in 2008 een winkelproduct, namelijk een tas. Vereiste was het gebruik van garens uit de in 2008 opgezette Garenbank in het TextielLab. Boon koos voor fantasiegarens zoals polyurethaangaren (Rubco) en technische garens zoals reflecterend en krimpgaren. Zij ontwikkelde een rechthoekig dubbelweefsel, vervaardigd op de computergestuurde Dornier-weefmachine. Eén kant van het weefsel dat als binnenzijde van de tas fungeert, is zacht en ingetogen. Op deze kant is voornamelijk het gebruikte krimpgaren op een ketting van biologisch katoen zichtbaar als mede enkele strepen van het Rubcogaren. De andere kant doet aan reptielenhuid denken en is stugger door het gebruik van het Rubcogaren, dat bestaat uit een kern van polyester met een omhulsel van polyurethaan. De driedimensionale structuur komt tot stand doordat krimpgarens in een strepenpatroon mee zijn geweven. Wanneer de stof na het weven wordt gestoomd krimpt dit garen, waardoor het stugge polyurethaangaren opbolt. 
Door het splitsen van de ketting op bepaalde gedeelten ontstaan partieel holle ruimtes in het weefsel. Zij dienen als insteekzakje voor een mobiele telefoon en als tunnel waar doorheen een kabel kan worden geschoven. Deze kabel vormt het handvat van de tas. Het reflecterende garen dat is mee geweven licht subtiel op bij directe lichtinval, bijzonder in het donker. ","14924","nl","'Reflect', tas met driedimensionale structuur","IMAGE","nl","2008","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","Highlights TextielLab: Glowing Caterpillar","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_14924","localID/europeana-fashion/14924","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_14924","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","",""

Als de inslag er in gebracht wordt, kunnen er drie losse lagen tegelijkertijd worden geweven. Door de zelfkanten niet te splitsen ontstaat daar één vastgeweven strook die het geheel bij elkaar houdt. De stof wordt opengeklapt en…een basiskledingstuk is geboren.
Vanuit zijn visie dat het silhouet van de vrouw over volume gaat, voorziet Jan Taminiau de meervoudige dubbelweefsels van elastiek, waardoor volumes ontstaan. Door elastiek op de hoogte van de taille, de hals en de kraag mee te weven, ontstaan – uit de techniek voortkomende - insnoeringen en soms het effect van smokwerk. Veel experimenten gaan vooraf aan het uiteindelijke resultaat. Proeven worden gedaan met verschillende elastieksoorten en inslaggarens als goudkleurige lurex en grove linnens die het gevoel van aangetaste goudborduursels moeten oproepen. Een associatie die wordt versterkt door te weven met lange losse draden, flotteringen genoemd. 
Taminiau’s hang naar oude materialen en ambachtelijke technieken is tot in detail doorgevoerd. Authentiek textiel combineert hij met de ingenieuze dubbelweefsels; chiffon en tafzijde met grove linnens en jute; Swarowski steentjes die als dauwdruppels fonkelend op de stof zijn geborduurd met verweerde materialen als oude strandstoelenstof - inclusief de spijkergaatjes - gebruikt voor de broekjes onder de jurken. Geïnspireerd door de vrouw met een ‘kinderlijke onbevangenheid‘ in combinatie met ‘een stoere kijk op het leven’ laat Jan Taminiau een collectie zien die in het teken staat van de vrouwelijke vorm.‘De rode draad binnen de collectie is het inpakken en het uitpakken van jezelf, zoekend naar de juiste vorm voor het moment’, aldus Taminiau. De cocktailjurken in uiteenlopende vormen kunnen in een handomdraai in een totaal ander silhouet veranderen: jas wordt jurk, jurk wordt stola, jack wordt rok. De transformaties van één en hetzelfde kledingstuk moeten in werkelijkheid worden gezien om ze te kunnen doorgronden. ","14950","nl","'Weefjurk' uit Couture Collectie 'Follies - Autumn/Winter 2007-2008'","IMAGE","nl","2007","nl","ontwerper/uitvoerder","nl","Amsterdam","Van Labyrinth tot Big Mama, projecten uit het TextielLab","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_14950","localID/europeana-fashion/14950","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_14950","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/14950-01.jpg","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/14950-01.jpg"

Met het in wit mohair gebreide vest 'Scoop Vanilla' combineert ze haar inspiratiebronnen - het ijsbolletje en de wafel - en speelt met gelaagdheid. Voor de mouwen is eerst een dubbelbreisel gemaakt met  lagen die deels los van elkaar zitten. Het elastiek aan de ene kant van het breisel zorgt ervoor dat de stof in elkaar trekt, waardoor een mooi smokeffect ontstaat. Het mohair aan de andere kant gaat door het intrekken van de onderzijde bol staan, zodat er volume komt. Het lijfje van het vest bestaat uit een enkelvoudig breisel in zilveren lurex en wol, dat door ingebreide lijnen van elasthan plaatselijk wordt ingesnoerd. 
Als de stoffen zijn gebreid worden ze op de pop gemouleerd tot het gewenste model ontstaat. Voortbordurend op 'Scoop Vanilla' ontstaan andere versies, onder andere voor Groenewegens nieuwe collectie 'Faint Vibrations Fall/Winter 08/09': een knielang oudroze vest 'Brains'. In dit model is het 'smokwerk' door een verandering in het breipatroon veel fijner geworden. In nieuwe versies wordt steeds het breipatroon aangepast om hierin verbeteringen te bereiken. Veel handwerk in het eerste model kon op die manier vervangen worden door oplossingen met de breimachine. ","14955","nl","Vest 'Scoop Raspberry'","IMAGE","nl","2007","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","Van Labyrinth tot Big Mama, projecten uit het TextielLab","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_14955","localID/europeana-fashion/14955","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_14955","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/14955.jpg","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/14955.jpg"

Het halssieraad ""Leguaan"" is geïnspireerd op de geknoopte of gebreide stootbumpers op de voorkant van vissersboten, de leguaan. Het werk vertelt over het verdwijnen van de visserij en traditionele ambachten. Het materiaal voor dit sieraad is tot stand gekomen met de hulp van Dhr. Gerrit Steenbergen, gepensioneerd touwslager te Gorssel. Touwslagerij Steenbergen is één van de weinige overgebleven touwslagerijen in Nederland en de laatste waar met natuurlijke materialen als hennep en vlas gewerkt wordt.

Jan Taminiau maakte in februari 2011, tijdens de opening van de Amsterdam Fashion Week, furore met deze couture collectie 'Irradiance'. Alle stoffen hiervoor waren in het TextielLab geweven. Een van zijn outfits, gemaakt van glow in the dark garen, met bijbehorend masker en hoge pumps is voor de museumcollectie aangekocht. De collectie gaat over verstoppen, maar ook over onthullen en veranderingen, terwijl de tijd doortikt. De sfeer is duister, de kleuren zijn wit, zilver en grijstinten tegen zwart aan. Omdat er glow in the dark garen is toegepast lichten de patronen in een duistere setting op.
Barokke patronen, vanwege hun lijnenspel voor Taminiau een boeiend uitgangspunt, vormen het basisdessin. Dit dessin werd voor elk silhouet aangepast: vergroot, verkleind of doorlopend in de mouw. Het is uitgevoerd als dubbelweefsel, een plat vlak bestaande uit verschillende lagen, dat door open te klappen zijn driedimensionaliteit krijgt. Bij de presentatie kan aan een achterwand een kleed met het volledige patroon (d) worden gehangen. Dit maakt duidelijk dat het weefsel vrijwel direct draagbaar is.

'Ready-Made' is een collectie waarin de opvulbaarheid van materialen een rol speelde. De vormen zijn vooral basic. Met deze jas is getest hoeveel vulgaren gebruikt kon worden op de Jacquardweefmachine, welke verschillende garens konden worden toegepast en hoe de kleuren ten opzichte van elkaar toonden. Het concept gaat over het productieproces: er zijn patroononderdelen direct in de juiste vorm geweven. Hierdoor is het mogelijk dat de dikke, reeds opgevulde delen, nadat zij uit de stof zijn geknipt, direct aan elkaar kunnen worden gestikt.

Ontwerper Borre Akkersdijk werkte in het TextielLab aan breisels die met een vuldraad zijn opgevuld. Het resultaat is een aantal 'stuffed' kledingstukken: een broek, parka, cape, broekpak en colbert, waarvan de patroondelen kant-en-klaar uit de machine komen. Voor de ontwerpen van de kledingstukken maakte hij veel schetsen en tekeningen. Daarnaast naaide hij proefmodellen van de kledingstukken in een ander materiaal. De dessins zijn ontleend aan een oude kelim van een favoriete tante, die onlangs overleed. Omdat dit kleed met de hand is geweven, vertoont het scheve lijnen, onregelmatigheden en een doorleefdheid die door Borre in de computeromzetting zijn overgenomen. Het is als het ware zijn persoonlijke handtekening in een verder industrieel product. Tijdens het breiproces onderzocht hij of de gehele lap gedessineerd moest zijn of slechts de patroondelen, die uit de lap worden geknipt. Als de patroondelen uit de stof zijn geknipt, zijn ze 'ready to sew': afwerken is niet nodig. ","15468","nl","'Knitting 3d patterns' C2-BB06 (broekpak)","IMAGE","nl","2011","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","Inside Design Amsterdam","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_15468","localID/europeana-fashion/15468","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_15468","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/15468-01.JPG","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/15468-01.JPG"

Borre Akkersdijk experimenteerde op de grote rondbreimachine in het TextielLab met het maken van dik opgevulde breisels. Speciaal voor zijn project werden zogenoemde bandfournisseurs aan de machine bevestigd. Hiermee is het mogelijk breisels te maken die met vuldraden worden opgevuld. Het onderzoek richtte zich op het breien van lappen waarin patroondelen zijn opgevuld. De randen blijven aan elkaar gehecht, waardoor, als de patroondelen uit de ondergrond worden geknipt, de vulling er in blijft zitten. Afwerking is niet meer nodig. De eerste test, met alleen een mouw, wees al direct in de goede richting. Daarna volgden kleurtesten in het eigenlijke dessin, een met de hand getekend kelimmotief. Hoe mengen de kleuren zich, in hoeverre moeten zij afwisselen en het patroon volgen? Uiteindelijk is besloten om de outfits in kleurmengingen te breien, omdat de stof hierdoor levendiger en spannender wordt.

(a) zwart uitgevoerde top, met aan de onderzijde een strookje naaldkant en aan de linkermouw een door Painted zelf aangezet loshangend mouwtje. (b) in mintgroen uitgevoerde top met in het voor- en achterpand strookjes opgenaaid naaldkant in mintgroen met rode en roze accenten. (c) jurk, aan de bovenzijde beige, aan de onderzijde rood. Op verschillende plaatsen zijn er strookjes naaldkant aangezet. 
Alle modellen hebben aan de bovenzijde een klein, opgenaaid koper labeltje met opschrift 'Painted'. 
Alle modellen kunnen als onderkleding of als bovenkleding worden gebruikt.
'Painted Secret' is een serie delicaat, volledig op vorm gebreid ondergoed uitgevoerd in zijde/cashmere.
Het gebruik van de intarsia techniek, waarbij afwisselend met één tot drie draden gebreid wordt, maakte het mogelijk om te spelen met verschillende transparanties.
Zowel de hemdjes als de jurken komen voort uit hetzelfde patroon, uitgevoerd in verschillende kleuren.
Elk kledingstuk heeft een uniek karakter gekregen door de toevoeging van handlace en geweven kledingelementen door zowel de meesters als Painted.
De machine en de verschillende handen vullen elkaar aan in dit werk. Painted gelooft in de kracht van samenwerking en het plezier van het maken. Hun wens is bijna vergeten ambachten toe te passen in hedendaagse kleding en zo mee te nemen naar de toekomst. 
Deze specifieke manier van werken vormde de directe aanleiding om het mode-collectief Painted, onder leiding van modeontwerper Saskia van Drimmelen en theaterregisseur Margreet Sweerts uit te nodigen om een collectiestuk te ontwikkelen.
Painted werkt samen met meesters in unieke handmatige technieken, zoals naaldkant en koordborduren uit Bulgarije en kralenwerk uit de Native American Assiniboine traditie.
Een grote uitdaging was om het handgemaakte aspect te verenigen met het machinaal vervaardigd breisel uit het TextielLab.
Bij de modellen hoort een film. ","17271a=c","nl","'Painted Secret'","IMAGE","nl","2011","nl","ontwerper","nl","Amsterdam","","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_17271a=c","localID/europeana-fashion/17271a=c","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_17271a=c","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/17271A-01.JPG","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=reg/17271A-01.JPG"

""Het uitgangspunt voor de collectie was een top (testlap 1) gemaakt van een lap die ik in eerste instantie bedoeld had als sjaal. Ik was gecharmeerd van de structuur gecombineerd met de plaatselijke elastiek die de top vorm gaf. Met dezelfde ingrediënten in een ander garen ging ik aan de slag. Het gekozen garen was een wilde zijde. Het voelde soepel maar het resultaat bleef dicht en compact zoals de top. Dat wilde ik doorbreken, het moest luchtiger en open."" (C.G.)
b: Testlap 3, complete top, gebreid in donkerblauw, bovenaan geplooid door een tunnel met gevlochten leren bandje.
""Ik nam een 'hap' uit het patroon, in eerste instantie met rechte lijnen als een driehoek, daarna werden het gebogen lijnen. Ik spiegelde deze en zo ontstond het idee voor de vlinder."" (C.G.)
c: Testlap 7, (Swallowtail) gebreid in felblauw, zwart en grijs, deels gerimpeld door elastiek.
""Dit patroon heeft veel problemen opgeleverd in de overgang van dubbeldraads rib (afwisselend vóór en achter breien) met ajour, naar enkeldraads vóór breien met ajour. Enkeldraads breien met een fijn garen is zeer kwetsbaar, vooral daar waar verschillende technieken en garens (intarsia) in elkaar overgaan. Elk figuur in het patroon betekent minimaal 1 draadgeleider, daar waar de figuren raken worden deze gehecht. Bij de verbinding tussen twee draadgeleiders gaat het gemakkelijk verkeerd, zeker daar waar ajour wordt gebreid omdat hier de naalden behalve breien ook rijen moeten omhangen. De kans is groter dat een draad van de naald afglijdt, en niet  goed wordt gehecht aan de tweede figuur. Daarnaast is het een knappe klus om ervoor te zorgen dat de draadgeleiders niet op elkaar botsen. De grafische horizontale en verticale lijnen in het patroon zijn elastiek banen.  Die geven vorm aan de lap. Het vraagt om een voortdurende verfijning van het patroon in technisch opzicht om een breisel als dit vlekkeloos op de machine te laten lopen. Dat heeft voor dit patroon meer dan drie dagen geduurd, omdat het proces vol zit met onvoorziene kleine en grote valkuilen. Breien vereist geduld, zelfs wanneer een digitale machine het uiteindelijk voor je doet. Hardnekkige problemen die bleven aanhouden ongeacht wijzigingen en aanpassingen in het patroon. Hier volgt de verklaring van Jan Willem (demonstrateur breimachine): 'Zwart garen is vaak moeilijk te verwerken want stugger dan de meeste andere kleuren. Dat komt doordat bij verfbaden die mislukken het garen wordt doorgeschoven naar een donkerder verfbad. Zwart garen is zo mogelijk voor een tweede en soms derde of vierde keer geverfd. Met alle pigmenten wordt het garen steeds stugger en gaat de kwaliteit achteruit. Wanneer je pech hebt is het garen dus niet meer te gebruiken.' "" (C.G.)
d: Testlap 9 (Speckled wood), gebreid in d.blauw en zwart met witte stippen en veel veiligheidsspelden. ""Bij de hechting met een stip wordt gemakkelijk de draad gemist, de steek valt en veroorzaakt een ladder. De ajour (gaatjes) vormen hierbij een extra risico, dus die haalden we rondom de stippen uit het patroon en de instelling van de machine werd iets 'vaster' gezet omdat losse lussen eerder van de naald vallen.""

Het TextielLab werd hierbij volop ingezet.
Gebaseerd op een geheel eigen wereld van meisjes, zwart-witte bloemen, vogels, meisjes, ragfijne draden en structuren vormt Merel Boers’ werk een feeërieke vlucht uit de werkelijkheid. Mode en illustraties zijn in haar werk met elkaar verweven. Voor de opdracht van het Textielmuseum nam zij voorbeelden van de technieken frivolité en macramé uit de museumcollectie als uitgangspunt. Zij ontwierp ornamenten, die met de high tech borduurmachine op water oplosbare stof zijn geborduurd. Na oplossing van deze stof blijven sierlijke bloemen en planten gevormd uit zwarte draden over. Ontleend aan de vormentaal van de art nouveau zijn zij terug te vinden in haar uiteindelijke ijle outfits. Het verfijnde handschrift van de ontwerper is nog steeds onmiskenbaar aanwezig.

Verschillende Cobra-kunstenaars tekenen een kleurrijk ontwerp voor gedrukte sjaals. Voor kunstenaars als Karel Appel, Lucebert en Wolvekamp vormen deze ontwerpen zeldzame uitstapjes in de wereld van het textieldesign. Corneille is naast zijn schilderwerk altijd actief geweest in het dessineren van tal van gebruiksvoorwerpen, onder meer van textiel.  Zijn sjaal ‘Les oiseaux’ (De vogels) en het karpet sluiten aan bij zijn passie als schilder: ‘Mijn bewegingen op het doek worden altijd vogels, de vogel is het volmaakte beeld van de beweging.’ ","17596a=c","nl","Sjaal 'Elle se donne à rêver', uit de serie 'With the Season's Greetings'","IMAGE","nl","1988","nl","ontwerper","nl","","","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_17596a=c","localID/europeana-fashion/17596a=c","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_17596a=c","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/17596a.jpg","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/17596a.jpg"

Op de Salone di Mobile 2010 in Milaan draaide de presentatie van Droog om hergebruik. Onder de titel Saved by Droog presenteerden ze 5135 artikelen uit faillissementen. Hieronder 80 inklapbare stoelen, 20 handdoeken, 200 zoutstrooiers, 900 zakdoeken en nog veel meer. Droog vroeg veertien ontwerpers om ze nieuw leven in te blazen, 'om ze als ruw materiaal voor creatieve herinterpretatie' te gebruiken.
Studio Makkink & Bey liet op doodgewone zakdoeken (900 stuks) krantenpagina’s drukken. Zij selecteerde artikelen uit 30 dagen nieuws. Hier betreft het een artikel uit Dagblad De Pers van 11 maart 2010, met als koppen 'Stemmen is nogal moeilijk voor ons', 'het laatste uur van de tonijn' en ''Zonder postadres en geld ben je niks'. Een foto van de onderzijde van een jongensgezicht met diamanten en gouden tanden siert de voorzijde prominent. Het bijschrift luidt: F******motherf****** Tsja, de kids moeten zich kunnen uiten. Daarom gaat de moderne welzijnswerker rappen met zijn probleemjongere'.Het was mogelijk om in Milaan  borduurtijd te kopen. Deze zakdoek is gedurende twee uur door een vrouw met gekleurd borduurgaren bewerkt. Ook was het mogelijk zelf thuis de eigen accenten in borduurzijde aan te brengen. Dan kreeg je een borduurring en borduurzijde mee.

De jumper heeft een binnenjasje (c). Met video (d). De anthracietkleurige jumper heeft sterke 3D structuren, bestaande uit gebreid monofilament en mohair. Deze ruimtelijke effecten zijn ingegeven door een studie van de ontwerpster naar lavalandschappen. De ingebreide grafische motieven zijn ook organisch. de naam 'Trincula' verwijst naar een stelsel van planeten rond Jupiter. Deze planeten kregen ooit namen, ontleend uit boeken van W. Shakespeare. Met bijpassend kort rokje. De kleding is in maat 36 uitgevoerd.

De schors is  bestreken met latex (het gestolde sap van de rubberboom). Aan de boven - en onderkant zijn katoenen banden bevestigd die over de schouders en rug van de potentiele drager lopen. 
Het body piece ‘Wounded hevea’ maakt onderdeel uit van de 6-delige serie ‘Materialisation’, het afstudeerproject van de Franse textiel- en sieraadontwerper Caroline Bach aan de Gerrit Rietveld Academie in Amsterdam. Het gehele project is een kritisch commentaar op het mensonterende en het milieu aantastende productieproces van rubber. Voor de rubberproductie levert onder meer de Hevea brasiliensis, een rubberboomsoort uit Brazilië, het sap. Voor aanplanten van rubberbomen in monoculturen wordt in de Amazonas ecologisch waardevolle regenwoud gekapt, en voor het aftappen van de rubber sap worden mensen uitgebuit. Dit alles ten dienste van producten voor de transport- en technische sector zoals rubberen autobanden. 
Elk van de 6 werken uit ‘Materialisation’ verbeeldt één fase in het proces van zaad tot rubber eindproduct. Een productieproces dat voor velen onbekend is, wordt in de serie lichaamsstukken op subtiele wijze aangeduid. Door stukken te maken die als soort body pieces op het lichaam gedragen worden, creëert Caroline Bach een menselijke maat voor wat anders slechts koude informatie en kritiek zou zijn.

De buitenkant is gebreid met een garen van acrylmix en nylon, de vulling bestaat uit vilt. Het ingezamelde textiel bepaalt de kleur en vezelsamenstelling van het garen en het vilt. Om de gewenste volumes van het kledingstuk te bereiken zijn breisels ontwikkeld die rekbaar zijn, maar ook stijf genoeg. De combinatie van de gebreide rib die stretch geeft met het stijve vilt van Wolkat, creëert de parabolische volumes. Het stuk is vervaardigd van 100% gerecycled textiel en kan opnieuw worden gerecycled. In het werk van de Zweedse modeontwerper Stina Randestad (1985) ontmoeten ambacht, technologie en innovatie elkaar. Voor de collectieopdracht experimenteerde ze met fijne breigarens van het Tilburgse recyclingbedrijf Wolkat, gesponnen van afgedankt textiel en Wolkat vilt (vulling). Het ingezamelde textiel bepaalt de kleur en vezelsamenstelling van het garen en het vilt. Om de gewenste volumes van het kledingstuk te bereiken stond de breitechnicus van het TextielLab voor de uitdaging om breisels te ontwikkelen die rekbaar zijn, maar ook stijf genoeg. De combinatie van de gebreide rib die stretch geeft met het stijve vilt van Wolkat, creëert de parabolische volumes. Circulair denken is de ultieme focus geweest in de ontwikkeling van dit artistiek intrigerende kledingstuk. Het stuk is vervaardigd van 100% gerecycled textiel en kan opnieuw worden gerecycled met de faciliteiten van Wolkat.","18830","nl","Jurk 'Cirkels'","IMAGE","nl","2021","nl","ontwerper","nl","Stockholm","Long Live Fashion!","","localID/europeana-fashion/Aggregation_18830","localID/europeana-fashion/18830","nl","TextielMuseum","https://textielmuseum.nl/collectie/objecten?diw-id=brabantcloud_textielmuseum-objecten_18830","http://www.europeanafashion.eu/","Europeana Fashion","http://rightsstatements.org/vocab/InC/1.0/","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/18830.JPG","http://textielmuseum.adlibhosting.com/apiimages/wwwopac.ashx?command=getcontent&server=images&value=profnieuw/18830.JPG"
